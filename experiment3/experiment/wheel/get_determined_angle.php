	Example of server-side file that returns the angle the wheel is to be at when the spinning has stopped.
	NOTE: this angle will be placed at the location of the pointer that indicates the prize.
	
	In this quick example I always return 67 which is the center of prize 2 in the example wheel.
	You will need an apache server with PHP installed to run this file. I use XAMPP on my local machine.
