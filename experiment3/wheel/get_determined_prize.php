	Example of server-side file that returns the number of the item in the prize array that the user is to win.
	Up to you how you determine this on your site, for example randomly, or not so randomly.
	
	In this quick example I always return 2 so the user will always win prize 3.
	You will need an apache server with PHP installed to run this file. I use XAMPP on my local machine.
